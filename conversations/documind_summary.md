# DocuMind Chat Export — Summary

This folder stores a saved copy of your GitHub Chat export for the DocuMind project.

- Raw export (original JSON): [documind_export.json](../documind_export.json)
- Purpose: Preserve conversation history, prompts, design decisions, and notes used while building DocuMind.

Why keep this here:
- Easy reference when resuming work or writing documentation/case studies.
- Source for rebuilding prompts, reproducing discussions, and preparing interviews.

Quick notes (high level):
- Contains project problem statement, phased roadmap, cost estimates, Copilot Pro guidance, and interview-ready bullets.
- Use this file as the central pointer to the raw export.

Next steps:
- Commit these files to your repo to ensure they are versioned.
- Optionally move the raw JSON into this folder or keep it at project root.
